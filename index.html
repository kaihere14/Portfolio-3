      <p>
        Welcome to the portfolio of Arman Thakur, a Full-Stack Developer and
        Computer Science student passionate about building modern web
        applications, SaaS platforms, and AI-powered solutions. This portfolio
        showcases a range of projects demonstrating expertise in React, Next.js,
        Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and cloud technologies. Featured projects include
        NovaDrive, a cloud storage solution; AI-integrated tools; and technical
        blogs covering topics like DNS architecture, cURL, and network
        protocols. My goal is to create intuitive, high-performance, and
        visually stunning digital experiences. Explore my work, read my
        technical guides, and connect with me on GitHub, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
